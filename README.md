## 📝 Description

_The goal of this project is to build a modern web platform for the [legendary Pong game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) 🏓 — but with a twist: multiplayer, tournaments, chat, 3D graphics, and even AI opponents."_ 🚀

In simpler words: imagine gathering with friends, entering your nicknames, and playing Pong directly in your browser 🎮 — not only **one-on-one** on the same keyboard, but also **remotely against players online**, or even against a computer-controlled opponent (**AI**) 🤖. The platform keeps track of who plays against whom, organizes **tournaments** 🏆, and lets you **chat live** 💬 while the games unfold.

💻 Behind the scenes, we combined a frontend in **TypeScript + TailwindCSS** with a backend of **microservices** (for authentication, matchmaking, chat, etc.) powered by **Fastify** and **SQLite**. For security, we added **Google login**, **2-Factor Authentication**, and **JWT tokens**, while monitoring is handled through **Prometheus** & **Grafana**. The game itself is enhanced with **3D visuals** (BabylonJS) that give a fresh look to the classic pong.

✨ In its final form, this project is not just “Pong” — it’s _a full multiplayer gaming experience on the web, reimagined with today’s technologies, AI challenges, and 3D design_. ✨

🤯 Or, as complicated as:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23fd0bd5-f082-4f41-97c2-b0e5289a9908

#
#### 1️⃣ Ready-to-Play Games 🎮

When the user first enters the platform, they are welcomed by the **Main Page**, where they can choose from the following _predefined game modes_ to **play directly**:

![ready-to-play](./readme_assets/Ready-to-Play%20Games.gif)

- ⌨️ **1 vs 1 (same keyboard)** – Two players share the same device: one uses the **W A S D** keys, the other uses the **arrow keys**.
- 🤖 **Against AI** – Play a solo **1 vs 1** match against the AI. The game starts at **Level 1**, and each victory unlocks the next, more challenging level.
- 👥 **2 Players (Online)** – Join the matchmaking queue to play a 1 vs 1 match with another player online.
- 👥👥 **4 Players (Online)** – Enter the 4-player queue; once three other players join, the game starts automatically.

#
#### 2️⃣ Custom Games 🖌️

Alternatively, they can click the ***Custom Game*** button on the Main Page (see aboveꜛ) to create a personalized match by adjusting the available game settings:

![custom_game_settings](./readme_assets/custom_game_settings.png)

Using this Custom Game panel, users can _fine-tune nearly every gameplay aspect_:
- ⚙️ **Players**: Choose the number of physical and AI players.
- 🧠 **AI Difficulty**: Adjust from easy to hard for progressive challenge.
- 🕒 **Game Rules**: Set a **time or score limit** to end the match.
- 🧱 **Environment**: Enable **obstacle mode** for extra dynamics.
- ⚡ **Gameplay Options**: Decide whether players can lose points, get replaced by AI if disconnected, or be removed at zero score.
- 🌍 **Physics**: Activate _Kicker Mode_ to apply gravity-based movement to the ball.<br>

💡 With all these combinations, users can create ***hundreds of unique matches***—from quick duels to chaotic multi-ball battles.


#
#### 3️⃣ TOURNAMENTS 🏆

![tournaments](./readme_assets/tournaments.gif)

The **Tournaments** module enables users to _create, configure, and manage competitive matches_:
- 🏗️ **Creation**: Define the tournament name and choose the victory condition (time-based or score-based).
- 👑 **Administration**: The creator acts as the admin, managing invitations and controlling the tournament’s start.
- ⚔️ **Gameplay**: Each player faces all other participants in one-on-one matches. The player with the ***highest cumulative score*** across all matches wins.
- 📋 **Overview**: The Tournaments page provides filters to view:
	* all existing tournaments,
	* those the user participates in, or
	* those managed by the user.
#

### 💬 Live Chat

<!-- https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b44479aa-015d-42f2-a5a4-8ac006729a97 -->

![live_chat](./readme_assets/chatpreview.gif)

Our platform features a dynamic chat system supporting both **private conversations** 🤝 and **tournament-wide discussions** 🏆.

- **Private Chats** 💌
	* Send direct messages between users.
	* View the recipient’s profile directly from the chat window 👤.
	* Block or unblock other users 🚫.
	* **Invite directly to a 1v1 game** 🎮 — challenge your friend instantly without leaving the chat!
- **Tournament Chats** 🗨️
	* All tournament participants can communicate in a shared chat room.
	* Navigate directly to the tournament page from within the chat 🏓.
	* View the profiles of other participants easily 👥.<br>

Each chat box can be **minimized to the bottom-right corner** 🔽 or **expanded again anytime** ↩️, allowing you to stay connected while continuing your game.

### 🛠️ Backend & Monitoring system 

🔩 Our backend follows a ***microservices architecture***, separating the main application logic into smaller, independent services — **Auth**, **Match**, and **Chat**.<br>
This design allows each service to be **developed, tested, deployed, and scaled independently**, improving maintainability and fault isolation.
Using **SQLite** for each microservice provides lightweight persistence with minimal setup overhead, making it ideal for containerized environments and local development.

📊 🧐 For **monitoring and observability**, we integrated a complete stack with ***Prometheus, Grafana, Node Exporter***, and ***Nginx Exporter***.
- Prometheus collects real-time metrics from all services, 
- Grafana visualizes them through interactive dashboards, and 
- the exporters ensure both system-level and Nginx-specific performance data are continuously available.<br>

This setup gives us a _clear view of system health, traffic, and resource usage_ — helping detect issues early and ensure smooth operation.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/letsgogeeky/transcendence
```

2. Navigate to the project's directory:

```bash
cd transcendence
```
<!-- [❕ _Make sure you have <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=docker" alt="Docker" height="12"> [*Docker*](https://www.docker.com) installed, so that you can move on to..._] -->

<div align="center">

[❕ _Make sure you have <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=docker" alt="Docker" height="12"> [*Docker*](https://www.docker.com) installed, so that you can move on to..._]

</div>

3. Boot everything up with the help of our magic [`Makefile`](Makefile):

```bash
make up
```

> 🏁 _And if everything boots correctly the output should finish as follows:_
![makeup_succesful_output](readme_assets/makeup_success_output.png)

## 🚀 Usage

Now you can go to any broswer and access the website by simply typing:

![broswer_image](readme_assets/localhost_broswer.png)

which should serve you the following main page:

![main_page_video](readme_assets/main_page.gif)

❗️ At this point though, you would only be able to see the main pages _(Welcome, Log In & Sign Up pages)_ without being able to actually sign up & access the game.

💁‍♀️ Let's clarify now **WHY**'s that and what you can do to fully browse the website... 💪

#

### 🔑 The importance of the missing SECRETS in the .env file

When you first do `make up` this generates some certificates (`server.crt`, `server.csr`, `server.key`) and the following **`.env`** file:

![env_file](readme_assets/envfile.png)

This `.env file` is considered _"enough"_ for the containers to boot up and the frontend to be accessed at https://localhost. ❗️ However, it uses <span style="color:#9667F0;">placeholder values</span> (_the ones in the purple boxes above_) like `your-secret-key-here`, which means <span style="color:#F54570;">the core functionality (registration, login, SMS, Google OAuth, etc) will not work until they are replaced with **real credentials**.</span> ❗️❗️


<!-- - **Secrets** (`SECRET`, `COOKIE_SECRET`, `REFRESH_SECRET`): You can generate your own with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
- **Google OAuth** (`GOOGLE_ID`, `GOOGLE_SECRET`): You can obtain from Google Cloud Console.
- **Google App Password** (`GOOGLE_PASS`): You can generate from your Google Account → Security → App Passwords.
- **Infobip SMS** (`INFOBIP_ID`, `INFOBIP_TOKEN`, `INFOBIP_SENDER`): You can obtain from your Infobip Dashboard. -->

#### 🔎 Explanation of the necessary Secrets & How they can be obtained:

| Secrets | Functionality | How to Obtain |
|---------|----------------------------|---------------|
| SECRET, <br>COOKIE_SECRET, <br>REFRESH_SECRET | Are used to generate and verify JWTs or **session cookies**. Without real values, authentication tokens will either fail to generate or won’t validate. | You can generate your own with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| GOOGLE_PASS, <br>GOOGLE_ID, <br>GOOGLE_SECRET | Are required if the platform supports Google OAuth. Without them, **Google login** won’t work at all. | GOOGLE_ID, GOOGLE_SECRET: Obtain from Google Cloud Console.<br>GOOGLE_PASS: Generate from your Google Account → Security → App Passwords. |
| INFOBIP_ID, <br>INFOBIP_TOKEN, <br>INFOBIP_SENDER | Are for SMS verification (or similar). Without them, **phone-based 2FA** or notifications won’t work. | You can obtain from your Infobip Dashboard. |

<br>

✨ Once you get those 9 values, you can add them in the `.env` (_replacing the current placeholder values_), then you do `make up` again, and now you have the fully working website, where you can sign up and log in to play the game and access all features 🥳 🎉, as shown in the [Main Components](https://github.com/bitsbyMK/transcendence?tab=readme-ov-file#-main-components) above.
